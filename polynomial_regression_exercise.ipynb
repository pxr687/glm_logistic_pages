    "# Polynomial regression model building exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to build a variety of models in this exercise, in order to explore model-building techniques from both a Culture One and Culture Two perspective. This exercise is very open-ended - there are many different ways to implement the tasks. You can use the methods in the textbook pages, and you can search stackoverflow to find new techniques which might be helpful. \n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from where you are specifically directed to use a certain method, there is no one correct way of approaching these tasks, so please use the methods that make most sense to you. And please write the code yourself, don't use an AI friend...you can ask an AI to suggest methods you might use, but in your prompt please instruct it **not** to write any code for you. We strongly encourage you to try to think about each problem, and to use stackoverflow first, before using AI (if at all). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what we're going to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "- we're going to use a classical model building technique to find a ranking of the \"best\" models (e.g. the most parsimonious models, with respect to goodness-of-fit vs complexity)\n",
    "- we're then going to use cross-validation to see how these \"best\" models perform, and whether cross-validation implies a different \"best\" model to the classical method\n",
    "- we'll then evaluate different models performance on a \"test set\", e.g. data not used at all in the earlier fitting process. This will allow us to see whether the Culture One or Culture Two method correctly leads us to the model which performs best on the unseen test set...\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using a version of the [Auto MPG](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/9/auto+mpg) dataset, involving the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "`mpg` - miles per galon of fuel (continuous variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "`cylinders` - number of engine cylinders (multi-valued discrete variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "`displacement` - [volume of air displaced by the engine] (continuous variable)\n",

    "`horsepower` - the power produced by engine to move the car (continuous variable)\n",

    "`weight` - car weight (continuous variable)\n",
