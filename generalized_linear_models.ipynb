    "\n",
    "So, where there are $k$ predictor variables, the linear regression model is:\n",

    "\n",
    "Another way of writing this - which makes it easier to understand the generalizations of the model - is to use the notation of conditional probability, which is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\Large E(y_i|x_{i}) = b_0 + b_1 x_{i} $\n",
    "\n",
    "In english this reads as:\n",

    "- \"the expected value of $y_i$, given the value of $x_i$ is equal to $b_0 + b_1 x_{i}$\" \n",
    "- ... or ...\n",
    "- \"the expected value of $y_i$ is a linear function of $x_i$ with the slope $b_1$ and the intercept $b_0$\".\n",

    "Let's represent \"$E(y_i|x_{1i})$\" using the symbol \"$\\hat{\\mu}_i$\" (this symbol is called \"mu\", and the \"hat\" symbol indicates that this is a prediction from a model rather than a raw data value).\n",
